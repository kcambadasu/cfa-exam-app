    "question": "An analyst's unconditional EPS forecast is USD2.50. After learning that GDP growth will be low, the conditional EPS forecast falls to USD1.80. This revision is consistent with Bayes' reasoning because:",
    "options": [
      "The unconditional probability of low GDP was greater than 50%",
      "New information (low GDP) has updated the expected EPS to reflect the specific scenario",
      "The unconditional and conditional forecasts must always differ"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Conditional expected value E(EPS | low GDP) = 1.80 reflects the revised forecast given the specific scenario. The original 2.50 is the probability-weighted average across all GDP scenarios; the 1.80 is conditioned on one particular scenario."
